# OrbitSimulator
Earth orbit simulator - a Qt project.

## About
```OrbitSimulator``` is c++ written simulation software for analysis and prediction of objects and potential events in various levels of general Earth orbit.

## Why?
Two-fold. One, I have been interested in designing astrophysics simulation software since I was a child. My first love was space. So this project is dedicated to a large component of what has made me the curious adult I am today. 

The second reason for wanting to build something like this is more professional. I've been working as an engineer on a supply chain solutions team. I'm often tasked with completing analyses of varying levels of complexity, and I'm often required to model entire supply chains. Being able to build a simulation with performant code, in a nicely packaged and consise way, will help enable me to do more in the future within the engineering space (pun intended).
